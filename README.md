 Customer Churn Prediction API

Full-Stack Data Science & MLOps Project

Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Customer Intelligence Platform designed to predict customer churn using machine learning and deploy the model as a production-ready API.

The system covers the complete data science lifecycle:
Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Model Training → API Deployment → Cloud Hosting

The final model is accessible through a live FastAPI endpoint hosted on the cloud.
